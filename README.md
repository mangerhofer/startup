#Writers App

Have you ever tried to write a story? There is a lot that goes into writing a story, more so than just simply typing words on a page. Whenever I have tried to write a story, I end up with a million documents: from simple maps, to character outlines, and even plot outlines. What if we could put all of these documents in one place and connect it with the book? And if you are working on the story with someone else? Great! You can both be coauthors of the story, and work on all the documents at the same time.




###Key Features:
secure login

ability to upload different file types (jpeg, pdf, doc, etc)

ability to publish works under public or private

ability to share works with another for editing rights

commenting available on works users have access to (public/private)

browsing/reading published works available (to read only)

ability to follow other users 

## What I have learned:
I have learned how to successfully push and pull git repositories from Github and my development environment. The last time I tried doing this, I was pretty unsuccessful.

I have learned a lot more about how git works, there is a lot more to git than I originally thought.

I have also learned a lot more about how to write different notes.

**you can make bold notes**
*you can make italicized notes*
~~you can strikethrough~~
**bold _and_ italicize**

######So cool!
