# startup

## What I have learned:
I have learned how to successfully push and pull git repositories from Github and my development environment. The last time I tried doing this, I was pretty unsuccessful.

I have learned a lot more about how git works, there is a lot more to git than I originally thought.

I have also learned a lot more about how to write different notes.

**you can make bold notes**
*you can make italicized notes*
~~you can strikethrough~~
**bold _and_ italicize**

######So cool!
